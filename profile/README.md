SAP’s contribution to IPCEI-CIS

We are part of an EU initiative, an Important Project of Common European Interest (IPCEI) around Next Generation Cloud Infrastructures and Services (CIS). All participants together aim to build a high-performance cloud-edge infrastructure based on European values and ensure European competitiveness in the digital environment in the long term. The core aim is to create an overarching “cloud-edge continuum” that is not tied to individual providers. Our goal with ApeiroRA is to decisively strengthen the digital sovereignty for Europe.
