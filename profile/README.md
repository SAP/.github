# Welcome to the Open Managed Control Plane (openMCP) Project on GitHub

:wave: Welcome to the official GitHub presence of openMCP. We are part of [ApeiroRA](https://apeirora.eu/content/projects/) which is an Important Project of Common European Interest - Next Generation Cloud Infrastructures and Services (IPCEI-CIS).

## :globe_with_meridians: ApeiroRA?

ApeiroRA is a reference blueprint for an open, flexible, secure, and compliant next-generation cloud-edge continuum and therefore a key contribution to IPCEI-CIS. At a high level, the projects of ApeiroRA allow users to provider-agnostically fetch, request and consume services, and for service providers to describe, offer and provision their services.

By being open source, ApeiroRA provides a cross-border spillover effect, solidifying the foundation and future of the project.

## :handshake: openMCP and ApeiroRA

The Open Managed Control Plane (openMCP) enables extensible Infrastructure- and Configuration-as-Data capabilities as a Service. Based on the Kubernetes Resource Model, all resources in the cloud-edge continuum with ApeiroRA are accessible and managed via a declarative API and corresponding controllers and operators. Together with the controller which understand OCM and declarative deployment orchestrators, consumers can subscribe to a product release-train of software producers and implement an automated, GitOps-driven deployment workflow at the edges.
