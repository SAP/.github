# Contributing to an SAP Open Source Project

## General Remarks

You are welcome to contribute content (code, documentation etc.) to this open source project.

There are some important things to know:

1. You must **comply to the license of this project**, **accept the Developer Certificate of Origin** (see below) before being able to contribute. The acknowledgement to the DCO will usually be requested from you as part of your first pull request to this project.
2. Please **adhere to our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)**.
3. If you plan to use **generative AI for your contribution**, please see our guideline below.
4. **Not all proposed contributions can be accepted**. Some features may fit another project better or doesn't fit the general direction of this project. Of course, this doesn't apply to most bug fixes, but a major feature implementation for instance needs to be discussed with one of the maintainers first. Possibly, one who touched the related code or module recently. The more effort you invest, the better you should clarify in advance whether the contribution will match the project's direction. The best way would be to just open an issue to discuss the feature you plan to implement (make it clear that you intend to contribute). We will then forward the proposal to the respective code owner. This avoids disappointment.

## Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

Due to legal reasons, contributors will be asked to accept a DCO before they submit the first pull request to this projects, this happens in an automated fashion during the submission process. SAP uses [the standard DCO text of the Linux Foundation](https://developercertificate.org/).

## Guideline for AI-generated code contributions to SAP Open Source Software Projects

As artificial intelligence evolves, AI-generated code is becoming valuable for many software projects, including open-source initiatives. While we recognize the potential benefits of incorporating AI-generated content into our open-source projects there a certain requirements that need to be reflected and adhered to when making contributions.

When using AI-generated code contributions in OSS Projects, their usage needs to align with Open-Source Software values and legal requirements. We have established these essential guidelines to help contributors navigate the complexities of using AI tools while maintaining compliance with open-source licenses and the broader [Open-Source Definition](https://opensource.org/osd).

AI-generated code or content can be contributed to SAP Open Source Software projects if the following conditions are met:

1. **Compliance with AI Tool Terms and Conditions**: Contributors must ensure that the AI tool's terms and conditions do not impose any restrictions on the tool's output that conflict with the project's open-source license or intellectual property policies. This includes ensuring that the AI-generated content adheres to the [Open-Source Definition](https://opensource.org/osd).
2. **Filtering Similar Suggestions**: Contributors must use features provided by AI tools to suppress responses that are similar to third-party materials or flag similarities. We only accept contributions from AI tools with such filtering options. If the AI tool flags any similarities, contributors must review and ensure compliance with the licensing terms of such materials before including them in the project.
3. **Management of Third-Party Materials**: If the AI tool's output includes pre-existing copyrighted materials, including open-source code authored or owned by third parties, contributors must verify that they have the necessary permissions from the original owners. This typically involves ensuring that there is an open-source license or public domain declaration that is compatible with the project's licensing policies. Contributors must also provide appropriate notice and attribution for these third-party materials, along with relevant information about the applicable license terms.
4. **Employer Policies Compliance**: If AI-generated content is contributed in the context of employment, contributors must also adhere to their employerâ€™s policies. This ensures that all contributions are made with proper authorization and respect for relevant corporate guidelines.

## How to Contribute

1. Make sure the change is welcome (see [General Remarks](#general-remarks)).
2. Create a branch by forking the repository and apply your change.
3. Commit and push your change on that branch.
4. Create a pull request in the repository using this branch.
5. Follow the link posted by the CLA assistant to your pull request and accept it, as described above.
6. Wait for our code review and approval, possibly enhancing your change on request.
    - Note that the maintainers have many duties. So, depending on the required effort for reviewing, testing, and clarification, this may take a while.
7. Once the change has been approved and merged, we will inform you in a comment.
8. Celebrate!
