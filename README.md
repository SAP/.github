# Welcome to the ApeiroRA Project on GitHub

![ApeiroRA Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apeirora/.github/main/.github/assets/ApeiroRA.svg)

:wave: Welcome to the official GitHub presence of ApeiroRA. We are part of the Important Project of Common European Interest - Next Generation Cloud Infrastructures and Services (IPCEI-CIS) project launched by the European Union in 2023. Ap

## :globe_with_meridians: IPCEI-CIS?

IPCEI are cross-member-state initiatives defined in [Article 107(3)(b) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:12008E107). They serve as an important tool for states and the EU to further common strategic interests of the bloc.

The IPCEI-CIS [unifies twelve member states and over 100 partners](https://www.bmwk.de/Redaktion/EN/Artikel/Industry/ipcei-cis.html) aiming to strengthen Europe's digital and technological sovereignty by establishing the first Multi-Provider Cloud-Edge Continuum.

## :handshake: ApeiroRA and IPCEI-CIS

ApeiroRA is a reference blueprint for an open, flexible, secure, and compliant next-generation cloud-edge continuum and therefore a key contribution to IPCEI-CIS. At a high level, the projects of ApeiroRA allow users to provider-agnostically fetch, request and consume services, and for service providers to describe, offer and provision their services.

By being open source, we are providing a cross-border spillover effect, solidifying the foundation and future of the project.
